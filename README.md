# Password Generator 

## Would you like to generate a new password randomly?


This application would help us to generate a new password randomly.

You can pick numeric, special characters, lower cases, or/and upper cases with a length between 8-128 characters.

The user guide is below.

When you click on the “Generate Password” button. A message will come up.
